- üî• Upgrade system to boost diamond production
- üõ°Ô∏è Secure Move smart contract architecture
- üèÜ Leaderboards and reward distribution mechanisms
- üìà Designed for scalability and low-cost transactions

aptos move compile --package-dir move/

# Publish contracts to the Aptos network
aptos move publish --package-dir move/ --profile default
```

### Play the Game

- **Click**: Call the `click` function to increment your diamond count.
- **Upgrade**: Spend diamonds to buy upgrades that generate passive income.
- **Compete**: View leaderboards and compete for the highest score.

Example using Aptos CLI:

# Make a click
aptos move run-entry-function \
  --function-id "diamond_clicker::game::click" \
  --args "0xYourAddress"
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run Move unit tests
aptos move test --package-dir move/
```

## Configuration

- Adjust parameters such as diamond production rate, upgrade costs, and reward distribution directly in the Move modules.
- Update network settings in `aptos.yaml` for deployment to devnet, testnet, or mainnet.
